# Taxonomy of Memory for Robotics

This document provides a comprehensive taxonomy of memory approaches and techniques used in robotics research.

## Overview

Memory in robotics can be categorized along multiple dimensions. This taxonomy organizes memory approaches by their characteristics, use cases, and implementation strategies.

## Categories

### By Temporal Scope

- **Short-term Memory**: Working memory for immediate task execution
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage for learned knowledge and experiences
- **Episodic Memory**: Memory of specific events and experiences
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and facts

### By Function

- **Task Memory**: Memory for task-specific information
- **Spatial Memory**: Memory for spatial relationships and maps
- **Procedural Memory**: Memory for skills and action sequences
- **Associative Memory**: Memory for relationships between concepts

### By Implementation

- **Explicit Memory**: Deliberately stored and retrieved information
- **Implicit Memory**: Automatically encoded and used information
- **External Memory**: Memory stored outside the agent (databases, knowledge bases)
- **Internal Memory**: Memory within the agent's neural network or architecture

### By Application Domain

- **Manipulation Memory**: Memory for manipulation tasks and object interactions
- **Navigation Memory**: Memory for navigation and localization
- **Perception Memory**: Memory for active perception and scene understanding
- **Learning Memory**: Memory for lifelong and continual learning

## Detailed Classifications

### Long-Horizon Manipulation

Memory approaches that enable robots to perform complex, multi-step manipulation tasks over extended time horizons.

### Embodied Agents

Memory systems designed for agents that interact with physical environments.

### Active Perception with Memory

Memory-enhanced perception systems that actively gather and utilize information.

### Mapping & Localization Memory

Memory systems for spatial mapping, SLAM, and localization tasks.

### Episodic/Semantic Memory

Hybrid memory systems combining episodic and semantic knowledge.

### Retrieval-Augmented Policies

Policy architectures that retrieve relevant memories to inform decision-making.

### World Models

Memory-based models that learn and maintain representations of the world.

### Lifelong Learning

Memory systems that enable continuous learning and adaptation over time.
