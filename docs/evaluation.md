# Evaluation of Memory Systems in Robotics

This document outlines evaluation methodologies, metrics, and benchmarks for assessing memory systems in robotics.

## Overview

Evaluating memory systems in robotics requires considering multiple dimensions: performance, efficiency, scalability, and generalization.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Task Performance

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed successfully
- **Task Completion Time**: Time required to complete tasks
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of errors or failures
- **Task Quality**: Quality metrics specific to the task domain

### Memory Efficiency

- **Memory Capacity**: Maximum amount of information that can be stored
- **Memory Usage**: Actual memory consumption during operation
- **Retrieval Speed**: Time required to retrieve relevant memories
- **Storage Efficiency**: Compression ratio or storage optimization

### Generalization

- **Zero-shot Performance**: Performance on unseen tasks or environments
- **Few-shot Learning**: Performance with limited examples
- **Domain Transfer**: Performance across different domains
- **Robustness**: Performance under varying conditions

### Long-term Performance

- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Measure of knowledge retention over time
- **Lifelong Learning Metrics**: Performance across multiple tasks over time
- **Memory Persistence**: Ability to retain information over extended periods

## Evaluation Benchmarks

### Manipulation Tasks

- Long-horizon manipulation sequences
- Multi-object manipulation
- Tool use and manipulation

### Navigation Tasks

- Long-range navigation
- Revisiting previously visited locations
- Dynamic environment navigation

### Active Perception

- Information gathering efficiency
- Scene understanding accuracy
- Object recognition and tracking

## Evaluation Protocols

### Standardized Tests

- **Benchmark Suites**: Standardized test environments and tasks
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Comparison with established methods
- **Ablation Studies**: Analysis of individual components

### Real-world Evaluation

- **Field Tests**: Evaluation in real-world environments
- **User Studies**: Human-in-the-loop evaluation
- **Long-term Deployment**: Extended operation evaluation
