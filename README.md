# Awesome-Memory-for-Robotics[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> 🤖 Memory is a fundamental capability to store, retrieve, and utilize past experiences for improved perception, planning, and decision-making. This mechanism enables robots to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and operate effectively in complex, dynamic environments.

Here we organized a list of resources on **memory for robotics**, including papers, code, datasets, and benchmarks.

## Taxonomy

Memory in robotics often mixes multiple axes:

- **Timescale**
  - *Contexual memory* (within-episode, short-term working memory)
  - *Episodic memory* (experience replay / trajectories / videos)
  - *Semantic memory* (facts, object affordances, task graphs)
  - *Long-term memory* (stable knowledge across tasks)
- **Representation**
  - key-value / slot memory, RNN / LSTM / Transformer state
  - retrieval over embeddings (RAG / vector DB)
  - 3D maps / NeRF / Gaussian splats / voxel grids
  - symbolic graphs (scene graphs / task graphs)
- **Usage**
  - policy conditioning (retrieve then act)
  - planning (search over remembered states)
  - perception (temporal integration / object permanence)
  - safety & failure recovery (remember mistakes)

Further, I divide memory into three categories: contexual memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory.

### Contexual Memory

Working memory maintains task-relevant information during execution. It enables robots to track object states, maintain spatial awareness, and hold intermediate computation results. It is usually implemented by keyframe, history and context-window.

### Episodic Memory

Episodic memory stores specific events and experiences from the robot's past, enabling recall of particular situations, trajectories, and outcomes. It is usually implemented by memory banks, replay buffers, or latent tokens.

### Long-term Memory

Long-term memory enables continuous accumulation of knowledge across tasks and sessions, supporting lifelong learning and adaptation without catastrophic forgetting. It is usually implemented by experience replay, skill transfer, or continual learning.

## Memory for Manipulation

### VLAs

Because non-markovian property makes VLAs prone to overfit, it's a huge challenge for VLAs to learn memory. We need to design spatial-temporal memory mechanisms carefully.

## Benchmarks & Evaluation

We treasure these features that actually pose challenges to memory:
- **Partial observability:** occlusions, hidden states, deferred rewards
- **Long-horizon:** requires recalling earlier observations/instructions
- **Distribution shift:** new scenes, objects, layouts
- **Recovery:** can the robots use memory to diagnose and retry?
