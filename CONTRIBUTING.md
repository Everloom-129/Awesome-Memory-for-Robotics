Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research summary! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.


## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Paper

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a new branch** for your contribution
3. **Add your entry** in the appropriate section of `README.md`
4. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description

### Entry Format

Please follow this format when adding new papers:

```markdown
| Paper Title | Venue | Year | [[Paper]](url) [[Code]](url) [[Project]](url) |
```

**Example:**
```markdown
| 3D-Mem: 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning | CVPR | 2025 | [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17735) [[Project]](https://umass-embodied-agi.github.io/3D-Mem/) |
```

### Guidelines

1. **Relevance**: Ensure the paper is related to memory mechanisms in robotics
2. **Quality**: Prefer peer-reviewed papers from reputable venues
3. **Completeness**: Include all available links (paper, code, project page)
4. **Accuracy**: Double-check URLs and publication information
5. **Placement**: Add entries to the most appropriate section
6. **Chronological Order**: Within each section, newer papers should be added at the bottom

### Categories

Choose the most appropriate category for your contribution:

- **Surveys & Overviews**: Survey papers and comprehensive reviews
- **Memory Systems & Cognitive Architecture**: General memory systems for robots
- **Episodic Memory**: Papers about storing and recalling specific experiences
- **Semantic Memory**: Papers about structured knowledge representation
- **Spatial & Scene Memory**: 3D scene understanding and spatial memory
- **Visual Memory for Navigation**: Vision-based navigation with memory
- **Memory for Manipulation**: Memory systems for manipulation tasks
- **LLM/VLM-based Memory Systems**: Memory with large language/vision models
- **World Models & Memory**: World models incorporating memory
- **Lifelong Learning & Continual Learning**: Continual learning and experience replay
- **Working Memory & Short-term Memory**: Short-term and working memory
- **Benchmarks & Datasets**: Evaluation benchmarks and datasets
- **Open-Source Projects**: Available implementations and tools

### Creating New Categories

If you believe a new category is needed:

1. Open an issue to discuss the proposed category
2. Provide at least 3-5 papers that would fit the new category
3. Explain why existing categories are not suitable

## Code of Conduct
